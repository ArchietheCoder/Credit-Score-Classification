Credit Score Classification Project

Objective: Develop a robust system for classifying credit scores to assess individual creditworthiness through a comprehensive EDA on customer and credit data. Craft features and employ a data-driven framework to enhance predictive accuracy, aiding financial institutions in risk assessment and decision-making.

Project Highlights:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Gain insights into the dataset's characteristics and distributions.
Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
Prepare data for modeling through feature scaling and categorical variable encoding.

Model Building and Evaluation:
Implement various machine learning algorithms (decision trees, random forests, xgboost, KNN).
Address class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE.
Evaluate model performance using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy metrics.

Repository Contents:

Jupyter notebook and pdf file  detailing EDA steps and data preparation. Model Building and Evaluation: Notebook showcasing model implementation and evaluation.
Recommendations and Insights: Summarized report with actionable insights for financial institutions.

Disclaimer: This analysis is based on available data and assumptions, and results may evolve with additional insights. Feedback and contributions are welcomed.
